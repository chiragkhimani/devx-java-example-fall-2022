//Interface just like an abstract class can not be instantiated
//interface can not be marked final => bc the whole point of interface is to
//be IMPLEMENTED(extended)
//can not be declared private or protected

//??Why do we need interfaces?
//Interfaces are need to tell the subclasses what they must do
//but not how to do it.
//Interfaces are very similar to abstact classes
//but the biggest difference is that
//abstact classes can have characteristics(instance variables)
//Whereas in Interfaces you only have behavior(method).
//plus abstact classes can also have non-abstract methods that are common for
//all sub-classes.
